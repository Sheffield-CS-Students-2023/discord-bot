To report exploits with the dot detector, please open a Pull Request adding the exploit to the `src/lib.rs` test cases. The format is easily understandable by looking at what is already there. If this issue is simply a whitespace or dot unicode character I have missed, please instead just add this character to the appropriate constant in a PR.
